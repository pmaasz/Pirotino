# Robotino
This is an Arduino based robotics project. It's still a work in progress. Feel free to contribute! I am still working out some quirks to make it more reliable and stable.

Find the hardware files <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3900324">here</a>.

Current electronics:
Arduino mega 2560
12 Servo SG51R
16 Kanal PWM/Servo IIC PCA9685 (servoboard)
TOF-Sensor VL53L0X
Fan
DS18B20 Thermo-Sensor

Next steps:
the leg part will become slimmer and lighter
the hip and foot part will be made so the motor is enclosed
the mount for the display will be improved
there will be a way to mount a battery and/or power bank
some time in there far future a turret will be added to hold a LiDar
cable-management and board mounts will be added
using raspberry pi zero
using myrobotlab or robot operating system
adding a camera
